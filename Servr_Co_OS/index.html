    <p class="tagline">A terrible linux distro based on debian (note that the placeholder is based on Ubuntu and is just an incomplete desktop environment, try it if you want, I would reccomend you install it in a Lubuntu VM). It is supposed to be a server operating system, but the current version is missing some of the most basic features one would expect to find in an operating system. We are hoping to have something released by Q3 2022. There is a good chance it wont be fully functional at this time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
